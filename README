## OUTDATED!!

Traveling in Google Maps

Inspired in the code of car trip [href="http://econym.org.uk/gmap/example_cartrip3.htm], 
I created this javascript small project. 

It allows to draw simultaneous vehicles, cars and planes, with travel into google maps
with some cool features, like changing sprite while rotate, smarty camera, and easy to 
understand and extend javascript code.

Hope you like this.
